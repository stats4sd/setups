# Stats4SD Setups
**Work in progress!!** This repo is in development, and is part of our current drive to improve our documentation surrounding all the processes, systems and tools we use for development of all kinds of project.

> Any comments + suggestions for this repository is welcomed, either as a PR, or as a comment on the associated [planner board](https://tasks.office.com/stats4sd.org/Home/PlanViews/H9d9yYoNjkOX_E6QkzwSCZYAChYQ?Type=PlanLink&Channel=Link&CreatedTime=637610158209220000).

## Introduction
This repository is intended to bring together information about how different coding projects are setup at Stats4SD. The goal is to allow better collaboration by sharing tools, presets and standards to make it easier for multiple coders to work on the same projects.

### Code Styling + Conventions
When multiple people are working on a project, it is important to have a shared set of styling conventions. This makes reviewing changes + merging much easier. Included in this repo are a set of style config files for use with projects, sorted by language:
- [php](php/Readme.md)
- [JavaScript](js/Readme.md)

## TODO:
- Bring in information about Laravel Projects / Packages / default setups.
- Add information about servers, and deployment toolchains.
- Add other common languages (R, R Markdown/Bookdown, Shiny, ODK?)
- Add defaults for database use, variable naming conventions, etc.
