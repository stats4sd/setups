The [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) file given is a good starting point for code styling for VueJS components within a Laravel project.

## TODO
- consider use of Typescript for more clarity in code, error checking and testing.
- review eslint settings:
  - what other globals should we add for Laravel projects?
- Default setups / templates?
