# MS Power Automate
This folder contains documentation for MS Power Automate flows, which can create a new Github issue when a pre-defined email account receives Uptime robot alert email.

For new data platform, it is not necessary to create new flow in MS Power Automate.
Instead, we need to create new monitors for staging env and live env in Uptime Robot.
