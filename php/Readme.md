# PHP Coding
For PHP projects, PHP-CS Fixer is our recommended tool to use to help everyone stick to a consistent styling.

For Stats4SD Laravel projects, we mostly follow industry standards by sticking to @PSR2, with a few oppinionated differences, shown in the [[.php_cs]] config file. This file should be used as the default styling config for all Stats4SD Laravel projects that don't have other speific requirements.

For info on what each rule means, see the [PHP CS Fixer Documentation](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/3.0/doc/rules/index.rst).
