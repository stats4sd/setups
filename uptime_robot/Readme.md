# Uptime Robot
This folder contains documentation for Uptime Robot monitor.

For new data platform, we need to create one monitor for staging env and another monitor for live env.

Staging env email alert should be sent to support@stats4sd.org.
Live env email alert should be sent to alerts@stats4sd.org.

It is highly recommended to send test notifications after creating new monitor.
